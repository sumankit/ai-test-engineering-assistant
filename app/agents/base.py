"""
Abstract BaseAgent and shared helpers.

Every agent in this package inherits from BaseAgent, which:
  - Enforces a single-method contract (`run`) — Interface Segregation.
  - Provides `__call__` so any instance is directly usable as a LangGraph
    node callable without extra wiring — Liskov Substitution.
  - Centralises shared, stateless utilities (_timed, _parse_json) that were
    previously copy-pasted across nodes — DRY + Single Responsibility.

Adding a new agent = create a new file, subclass BaseAgent, implement run().
Nothing else in the codebase needs to change — Open/Closed Principle.
